Simple Android app that can be used to search books from Google Play Books database using the Google Books API.

*This app is created as the seventh project of [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) program at Udacity.*

### Features
- Search books by volume from Google Play Books database simply by entering a keyword.
- Lightweight and minimalist design. Support for book details will be added in future version.

### What I have learned from this project
- Fetching data from an API using Android HttpURLConnection API.
- Using AsyncTask to perform network operations in the background thread.
- Parsing a JSON response to get the required data for the model class.
- Creating a ListView that contains the data and display it to the user.
